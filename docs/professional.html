        <h1>Current Profession</h1>
        <p>I currently work at <a href="https://sepco-erie.com/">SEPCO Erie</a> located at 1221
            Robison Road, 16509, Erie PA. I am a CNC Machine Operator, primarily specializing in
            setup, running, and processing on Sinico CNC Tube cutting machines. My responsibilites
            include, setting up the machines to run many different jobs for different customers. I
            also am responsible for the quality of my parts, and maintain a very high quality
            standard.</p>
        <p>I also have experience operating many other machines found at SEPCO, including the
            different mills, lathes, and other operations and services provided by the company.</p>
        <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
        <p>I have several years of experience working on houses with my father. He has taught me how
            to do interior work such as framing, flooring, drywall, painting, and minor electrical
            work and plumbing. On the outside of houses he has taught me how to do gutter work,
            siding, and different sorts of landscaping. </p>
        <h2>Non-Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>Due to my schooling and personal hobbies, I also have experience working on cars old and
            new. I am very familiar with engines and mainteance on cars. I also am very familiar
            with different makes, models, features, and reliability. I mainly focus on American cars
            from General Motors, and Japanese cars from Toyota.</p>
        <p>I also have several technology related hobbies relating to computers and home
            manufacturing in the form of 3D Printing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I have several computers that I built and use for many different tasks. I have my
                primary computer setup to be a powerhouse with lots of capability for design and 3D
                Modelling. I have a Secondary computer that I use as a sort of home sever to store
                files and take care of smaller tasks. I also have a laptop that I use for small
                scale design, modelling, and 3D Priniting on the go.</li>
            <li>I have two 3D Printers that I use for different tasks. My primary printer is a Bambu
                Lab P1S which I use for fast precision designing. I also have a Creality Ender 3
                that in the future I would like to modify to do different tasks. (I have a few in
                mind, but haven't decided on a specific task yet.)</li>
